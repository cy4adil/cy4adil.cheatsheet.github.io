                        <td>
                            This way of selection is known as selection by type. Here, we will use html element's tag name to select the specific element to apply the CSS properties.
                        </td>
                        </tr>

                        <td>Class Selection</td>
                        <td>
                            This selection is called selection by class. It starts with dot and then followed by the name of the class assigned to the specific html element. One class can be assigned to multiple html elements.
                        </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                        <td><span class="selector">#specialHeading</span></td>
                        <td>Id Selection</td>
                        <td>
                            This seleciton is called selection by id. It starts with number/hash sign and then followed by the name of the id. Every html tag/element can have only one unique id, we cannot assign one id to multiple html elements. So, id is always unique and points towards only one html element.
